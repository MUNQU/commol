//! # Commol Core
//!
//! Core data structures and abstractions for compartment modeling.
//!
//! This crate provides:
//! - Mathematical expression parsing and evaluation
//! - Common simulation engine interface
//! - Type definitions for models, populations, and dynamics
//!
//! ## Main Components
//!
//! - [`MathExpression`]: Parse and evaluate mathematical expressions
//! - [`SimulationEngine`]: Trait for implementing simulation engines
//! - [`Model`]: Complete model specification including population and dynamics
//! - [`types`]: All data structures for defining compartment models
