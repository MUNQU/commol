//! Core data types for compartment models
//!
//! This module contains all the data structures used to define and configure
//! compartment models, organized into logical submodules:
//!
//! - `conditions`: Logic operators, rules, and conditional expressions
//! - `parameters`: Model parameters and variable prefixes
//! - `population`: Disease states, stratifications, and population structure
//! - `dynamics`: Model dynamics, transitions, and rates
//! - `model`: Top-level model structure
